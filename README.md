Rescue the Princess
===================

Cmpe434 - Final Project - Rescue the Princess



The goal of this project is to build a robot which climbs and enters a tower, rescues the princess and brings her to safety. In the tower there are two chambers and in one of them there is the princess and in the other a dangerous dragon. Since our robot is a level 1 prince and the dragon is a level 25 boss, entering his chamber means instant death, so we should avoid him and directly find the princess. The tower is connected to the town with a ramp. In the town there are 10 villagers to tell us in which chamber the princess is kept, 6 of which tell the truth. We are supposed to explore the town and ask to townsfolk where the dragon keeps hides the princess, find her and bring her to his father, the Mighty King.

    * Explore the first floor
    * Climb to the second floor
    * Find the princess
    * Go down to the first floor
    * Navigate to the final area (starting area or the king)
